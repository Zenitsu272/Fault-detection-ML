# Fault-detection-ML
So here, i tried to create a machine learning model that uses the decision tree algorithm to predict the chances of a machine becoming faulty using sensory data.
Being a beginner to ML concepts, this basic project classifies whether a Machine would get faulty very soon or the machine is safe (no fault will be there in the near future.
The output mainly consisted of 2 possibilities [0,1]
1 being the machine would become faulty very soon or the chances of this machine being faulty is high
0 being the machine is safe in the near future or chances of this machine being faulty is low
Knowing that the possibilities of the output is only 2, I used the Desicion tree algorithm to evaluate this dataset. 
This comes under supervised learning thus the dataset is splitted into 2 (I/O). 
Also there is seperate allocation of the data for training and testing in the ratio of 7:3.
Also this model gave me an accuracy of more than 80% in almost all the cycles.
Since this is just the beginning of me making projects, help me and correct me if there's something to be done.
